### What in the world is this?
It's an i3lock wrapper, it grabs a screenshot from your DE, blurs it
and specifies it as the background image for i3lock.

### Show it to me!
When invoked, it'll leave you with a screen similar to:
![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vswarte/spellbound/master/example.png)
Where you can (as per usual) just start mashing in your password.

### Thanks!
- [vova616's screenshot](https://github.com/vova616/screenshot) huge thanks for writing this library but I really only needed the linux side-of-things, so I copied some of it.
- [BurntSushi's xgb bindings](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xgb) BurntSushi for the staggering amount of work he put into Golang's XCB bindings (xgb).
