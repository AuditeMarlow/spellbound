## What in the world is this?
It's an i3lock wrapper, it grabs a screenshot from your DE, blurs it
and specifies it as the background image for i3lock.

## Thanks!
- a lot of inspiration was taken from [i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy)
- I stole some of the screenshotting code from [vova616's screenshot](https://github.com/vova616/screenshot) (huge thanks for writing this but I really only needed the linux side-of-things)
